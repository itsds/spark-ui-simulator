# Decision log (ADRs)

Append new decisions at the bottom. Don't rewrite old ones; supersede them.

## ADR-001 — Render with the real Spark History Server from synthetic event logs

- **Date:** 2026-11-03
- **Status:** accepted
- **Context:** The first idea was a static HTML replica of the Spark UI. The
  owner then made the requirement explicit: "production-level Spark UI at any
  cost without any compromise in my learning". A running local server is fine.
- **Decision:** Generate Spark event logs and render them with the real
  History Server. Build no UI of our own except a small scenario portal.
- **Consequences:** Every page, sort, tooltip, DAG, timeline and REST endpoint
  is the real thing. The hard part moves to producing event logs that are
  valid and internally consistent. That needs reference logs and round-trip
  tests (Phases 1–2).

## ADR-002 — Target Apache Spark 3.5.9, YARN cluster mode

- **Date:** 2026-11-03
- **Status:** accepted
- **Context:** The owner targets Spark on YARN. The 3.5 line is still the most
  common in YARN production estates (EMR, CDP, on-prem Hadoop). 3.5.9 is the
  latest 3.5 patch on PyPI as of this date.
- **Decision:** Event logs follow the Spark 3.5 JsonProtocol and are rendered
  by History Server 3.5.9. YARN cluster deploy mode.
- **Revisit:** History Server 4.x can usually read 3.5 logs. Rendering the same
  logs on 4.x is an optional later phase.

## ADR-003 — Simulation-first metrics

- **Date:** 2026-11-03
- **Status:** accepted
- **Decision:** All metrics come from workload model → cost model → scheduler
  simulation, seeded. Faults are injected as causes. See `ARCHITECTURE.md`
  ("realism rules").
- **Consequences:** Adding a scenario means describing a workload and a fault,
  not writing numbers. The cost model needs calibration.

## ADR-004 — Project memory lives in the repo

- **Date:** 2026-11-03
- **Status:** accepted
- **Context:** The owner works across several Claude sessions. A
  session-specific memory tool (agent-memory plugin) failed to connect in the
  founding session.
- **Decision:** `CLAUDE.md` + `docs/ROADMAP.md` + `docs/SESSION_LOG.md` +
  this file are the memory. They travel with every clone and Claude Code loads
  `CLAUDE.md` automatically.

## ADR-005 — Structured Streaming deferred

- **Date:** 2026-11-03
- **Status:** accepted
- **Decision:** Batch only (Spark Core + SQL/DataFrame). The Streaming tab and
  scenarios are in the backlog.

## ADR-006 — Each incident scenario ships a "last good run"

- **Date:** 2026-11-03
- **Status:** accepted
- **Decision:** Each scenario generates a healthy previous run of the same job
  alongside the bad run, so the investigation can compare the two the way
  real on-call does.

## ADR-007 — Toolchain

- **Date:** 2026-11-03
- **Status:** proposed (Phase 1 finalizes)
- **Decision:** Python 3.11 managed by `uv` (inside PySpark 3.5's supported
  range). Generator package `sparksim`. Real PySpark 3.5.9 only for capturing
  reference logs. History Server via Docker Compose, with a no-Docker script
  as a fallback.
- **Open:** Java version. Spark 3.5 officially supports 8/11/17; the dev
  container ships 21. Use 17 (Docker image or a JDK download) if 21 causes
  problems.
